# AdventOfCode-2023

It's [that time](https://adventofcode.com/2023) of the year. This time around I'm gonna use this AoC to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 
As opposed to [last year](https://github.com/jrpinteno/AdventOfCode-2022) with C++, I have no previous knowledge of the language.
So the first days will most likely be a bit challenging, not because of the tasks, but to get used to the nuances of Rust.

Note: I _might_ also do it in C++, in fact that might be my first solve.
